  <p class="body">Maria Cristina is full professor of Chemical Engineering Fundamentals at the  University of Rome "La Sapienza" where now she teaches the courses of  Transport Phenomena and Chemical Reactors. She is  member of the teaching board of Chemical Engineering PhD.</p>


  <p class="body">Her  research activity, supported by over 150 scientific works, deals mainly  with phase equilibrium thermodynamics (especially concerning the application of results to the development of unconventional separation processes), chemical and biochemical kinetics and reactor modeling, chemical, biochemical and physical processes for pollutant removal, artificial organ engineering. Since 2005 he is involved in different research  projects on the production of hydrogen by steam reforming of natural gas or renewable feedstock and from water through thermochemical cycles powered by solar energy. In particular, she was the principal  investigator for University of Rome La Sapienza   in the COMETHY project (Compact Multifuel-Energy To Hydrogen converter  ) an EC-7FP Collaborative Project co-funded by the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU).</p>
