  <p class="body">Hendrik Heinz is an Associate Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at University of Colorado at Boulder. His research focuses on the simulation of biomaterials and nanomaterials at the nanometer scale. He develops the Interface force field for the simulation of all compounds across the periodic table in a uniform platform in high precision, with applications to alloys, biomaterials, catalysis, aqueous corrosion, mineralization, hydrogels, and polymer materials. He holds a Ph.D. degree in Material Science and Engineering as well as a M.S. degree in chemistry from ETH Zurich, Switzerland and completed postdoctoral work at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Ohio. He is an Associate Editor for the CNRS-owned New Journal of Chemistry, and earlier served on the faculty of the University of Akron, Ohio, from 2006 to 2015 and as an Associate Editor of RSC Advances. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (UK) and held several guest professorships. He won the Special Creativity and Career Awards from the U. S. National Science Foundation, the Sandmeyer Award from the Swiss Chemical Society, the Max Hey Medal from the Mineralogical Society, the Giovanni Novelli Prize from the Italian Clay Minerals Society, as well as a Hewlett-Packard Outstanding Junior Faculty Award from the American Chemical Society.</p>
