  <p class="body">Carlos Escobedo joins Queen’s University in 2013 as an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering. He received a B.Sc. from the National University of Mexico, MSc from University of Toronto, and PhD from University of Victoria, and was an NSERC postdoctoral fellow in the Bioengineering Laboratory at ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Carlos has published papers in different scientific journals related to micro- and nanotechnology, including Lab-on-a-Chip, Analytical Chemistry, Nature Communications, Small and Nano Letters, some of them featured in Optics and Photonics News, Nanowerk and Nature Photonics. He received the prestigious Early Researcher Award and the TD Most Influential Hispanic Canadian Award in 2018, and serves as Technical Chair for MEMS and Nanotechnology in the Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering. His research program involves the development of microfluidic systems, and micro- and nanostructures for analytical applications in biology, medicine and chemistry. </p>
